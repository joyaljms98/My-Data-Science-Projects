In this project we will be doing Analysis Using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. Here we can see that I have:

•	Explored FIFA football game skills & clustered football players based on their attributes. 
•	Used K-Means clustering to segment players based on their skills and analyze them. 
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis with Python and visualized final results in Tableau.
•	Found hidden insights that helps in future decisions for the gamers.
