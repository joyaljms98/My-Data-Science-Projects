In this project I have:

•	Predicted credit score for current credit card customers to reduce credit default risk.
•	Used SQL to extract data from the database and performed statistical analysis.
•	Analyzed entire data using Excel’s built-in AI.
•	Developed visualizations in python to present the findings to the marketing team.
